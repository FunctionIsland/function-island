Function Island | Open Source Dapps and Games on TRON

![Function Island Homepage](/screenshots/home_1.png)

## Introduction
Function Island is a collection of Open Source Dapps, with Smart Contracts deployed on the TRON network. It is a "just-for-fun" platform, aiming to make a fun experience of cryptocurrency trading and management. Anyone is able to use the software properly by installing a TRON Blockchain Wallet Extension or Dapp Browser, such as TronLink or TronWallet.me. There is also an instance of this composition hosted at https://functionisland.xyz - everyone is encouraged to fork the front-end and decentralise the project further!
