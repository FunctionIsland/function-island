Function Island | Open Source Dapps and Games on TRON

![Function Island Homepage](/screenshots/home_1.png)

## Introduction
Function Island is a collection of Open Source Dapps, with Smart Contracts deployed on the TRON network. It is a "just-for-fun" platform, aiming to make a fun experience of cryptocurrency trading and management. Anyone is able to use the software properly by installing a TRON Blockchain Wallet Extension or Dapp Browser, such as TronLink or TronWallet.me. There is also an instance of this composition hosted at https://functionisland.xyz - everyone is encouraged to fork the front-end and decentralise the project further!

## Included Dapps
### D1VS Game
 - Contract Address: TJ9KV8DdVhVbPAMWVHEHYnXBA4vqLwk6Jr
 
D1VS is an Hourglass "Proof of Weak Hands" game, with 10% Buy/Sell Fees, and 3% Referral Bonus rates. Dividends are earned as players buy and sell D1VS. Compound your earnings or withdraw anytime. This contract is also assisted by a secondary contract, "Pricefloor" - this contract holds D1VS, earning TRX Dividends like any other player. Pricefloor can never sell or transfer its D1VS - it can only keep buying more, reinvesting into the D1VS contract. As time goes on with the D1VS contract being used more, the Pricefloor will act as a "last player" - so if everyone sold out, the "second-last" player will always get SOMETHING for their D1VS.

### USDJ Exchange
 - Contract Address: TSEGf9jZCzLQMH2PTyF7f7NN3NfrbqHd5p
 
The USDJ Exchange enables quick and easy trade between TRX and USDJ, right on Function Island! Every trade is met with a 2% fee, which goes directly towards maintenance of the Function Island platform.
 
### FunctionNamesContract
 - Contract Address: TUE2vKwu6LsyN7GQvhLKnJ1S6fRNCoBWqM
 
FunctionNamesContract is an interface and contract pairing added to Function Island, enabling users to set and change a Username for their address when their wallet is unlocked and enabled on the website. Secondary functions include the ability to buy a name for an address that is not your own. This may be a nice little gift idea for a fellow player - but this is up to you - still costs 25 TRX to set/edit the name.
